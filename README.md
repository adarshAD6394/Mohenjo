# UrbanDrive

## Overview
UrbanDrive is a decentralized car rental platform built on blockchain technology, offering car rental services using both digital (crypto) and fiat currencies. It utilizes Solidity smart contracts, Truffle framework, React for the frontend, and Node.js for the backend. The application is implemented on the Binance Smart Chain testnet, enabling users to link their Metamask wallet for seamless transactions.

## Features
- **Smart Contract**: Developed a Solidity smart contract using Truffle for the car rental business. This allows business owners to transition their operations from web 2 to web 3 and conduct transactions in both digital (crypto) and fiat money.
- **Decentralized Application (Dapp)**: Built a Dapp on the Binance Smart Chain testnet, enabling users to rent cars and make payments securely using blockchain technology.
- **Metamask Integration**: Users can link their Metamask wallet to the application, providing a convenient and secure way to manage their digital assets.
- **Google Maps API Integration**: Implemented location-based pick and drop services using Google Maps API, enhancing the user experience by providing accurate location information.
- **IPFS Integration**: Utilized IPFS for decentralized storage, ensuring data integrity and resilience. IPFS serves as a peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data, enhancing the scalability and reliability of the application.
